                                        <p>was born with martial arts in his blood. As a child he chose to follow in his older brother's footsteps, learning the secrets of Kendo and Karate under the master, Marc Angevin. As he grew older, he mastered Muay Thai, Kickboxing and practiced Greco-Roman Wrestling. At age 19 he discovered the Penchak Silat and was coached by Charles Joussot and Franck Roppers, both of whom realized Cheick was a unique athlete keen on writing his own history. Currently he is training Gilles and preparing him for upcoming movie projects, sports competitions and events - by far the most challenging training Gilles has ever been through.</p>
