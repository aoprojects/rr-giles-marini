                                <p>Fresh off his role as Sebastien in the comedy-drama Devious Maids, Gilles Marini’s charm and zest for life has attracted fans all over the world.</p>
                                <p> Born to a Greek mother and Italian father in Grasse, a small city on the French Riviera, Marini worked in his father's bakery from the age of eight to his high-school graduation. Marini then joined the French army and was stationed in Paris, where he served as a fireman for the famous Paris Fire Brigade (Brigade des Sapeurs Pompiers de Paris).</p>
                                <p>While living and serving in Paris, he met photographer <a href="https://fredgoudon.viewbook.com/fredgoudon/editorial" target="none">Fred Goudon</a>, who introduced him to the world of modeling. After fulfilling his military duties, Marini went to the United States to learn English while working as a model. One of his first modeling jobs was a television commercial for Bud Light beer. Other commercials soon followed and in 2005 Marini made his movie acting debut in the horror flick Screech of the Decapitated. </p>
        
                                <p>Marini found himself in the international spotlight after appearing in what some have called the second greatest shower scene in film history in 2008's Sex and the City: The Movie.</p>
                                <p>Capitalizing on his SATC popularity, ABC cast Gilles in the eighth season of Dancing with the Stars where he quickly became a fan favorite, finishing second by less than one percent of the votes. He was also invited to participate in the first ever All-Stars edition of DWTS after viewers voted Marini the "Best All-Time DWTS Contestant."</p>                               
                                <p>Marini was introduced as a recurring character on ABC's hit family drama Brothers &amp; Sisters in Fall 2009. He played Luc Laurent, the French love interest of Rachel Griffiths' character Sarah Walker. Originally Marini was supposed to appear in a five-episode arc, but he was soon promoted to a series regular. The series was cancelled in May 2011, but remains a favorite with audiences worldwide, airing in syndicated reruns in more than 50 countries. </p>                                 
                                <p>In the fall of 2011 Gilles was cast as Angelo Sorrento in ABC Family's critically acclaimed family drama, Switched at Birth. Sorrento is the biological father of Bay Kennish (Vanessa Marano), absent father of Daphne Vasquez (Katie LeClerc), and ex-boyfriend of Regina Vasquez (Constance Marie). Marini was originally cast on a recurring basis then promoted to series regular through the 2014-15 season. </p>
                                <p> Television audiences have also seen Marini guest-starring in hit primetime series such as Castle, Modern Family, and Hot in Cleveland. Other appearances include Royal Pains, Are You There, Cheslea?, Nip/Tuck, Ugly Betty, Dirty Sexy Money, Criminal Minds, and Windfall as well as daytime dramas The Bold and the Beautiful and Passions. Marini was named one of People Magazine's top ten "Sexiest Men Alive" for 2009. His portrait is featured in celebrity photographer John Russo’s book, About Face, published by Pixie Press Worldwide.</p>
                                <p>Perry Ellis International chose Gilles Marini to be the face of its new Axist clothing line in 2011, citing his effortless style, worldly wisdom and off-the-cuff wit, they described him as "the perfect embodiment of the brand. Athlete, family man, actor and dancer, this French-born Italian soccer-player has truly experienced many of the things life has to offer. Known both on the big screen and the small screen ... no one exemplifies this aesthetic more than Marini." Their "Reasons to Axist" campaign featuring Gilles won the 2013 Miami Gold Addy Award.</p>
                                <p> Marini became an American citizen in June 2012 and, in an emotional interview after being sworn in as an American citizen, said he was very proud to be an American now. He also said becoming a US citizen was a dream that took ten years to achieve.</p>
                                <p> Marini and his wife, Carole, live in Southern California. They have a son, Georges, and a daughter, Juliana. Marini loves cooking, spending time with his family, meeting and talking to people, and sports such as soccer and MMA (mixed Martial Arts).</p>
